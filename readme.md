# Card Game

The objective of this project is to create a simple card game based on the following specification. The game
will consist of rounds, where each player draws a single card from a shuffled deck. The playersâ€™ cards will be
compared to determine the winner of the round (whose score will be increased) and/or any penalized players (whose
score will be decreased). A scoreboard should be displayed at the end of each round (to track player progress).
Rounds will continue until an overall game winner is determined.
